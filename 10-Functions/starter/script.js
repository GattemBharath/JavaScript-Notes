 ! But once again, JavaScript does not have pass by reference.
So if you already know some programming, but are new to JavaScript, be sure to understand this.
And I know it's confusing, because as we just learned, for objects, we do in fact pass in a reference.
So the memory address of the object. However, that reference itself is still a value.
It's simply a value that contains a memory address.
So basically we pass a reference to the function, but we do not pass by reference,

/*
Explanation
When we pass a primitive type as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the original value, and works with it.
When we pass an object as an argument on a function, the function makes a copy of the reference that points to the place of the memory where the object is stored. This copy is a value itself, is not a reference. Through this value, the original object can be modified from inside of a function.
Summary
- In programming languages, Arguments can be passed by value, or passed by reference.
- JavaScript works only passing by value.
- When we pass primitive values, the function works with a value, which is a copy of the original value.
- When we pass an object, the function works with a value, which is a copy of the reference that address to the spot in the memory where the original object is in the memory (still is not a reference).

This transform a function does not care at all,how the string is transformed.
It doesn't care about this level of detail. Okay, all that wants to do is to transform a string,
but it doesn't care how it should do it.So what I mean is that we could have taken,
this code here(oneWord) and written it directly into transformer,
or even this code here(upperFirstWord),right.

That would have worked just the same, but instead we abstracted this
code away into other functions.

So again, we created a new level of abstruction and by doing this our main transformer function,
here is really only concerned with transforming the input string itself.
But no matter how that transforming itself actually works.
So it's basically delegating the string transformation to the other lower level of functions,

    console.log(

    );
    this.bookings.push({ flight: `${this.iataCode}${flightNum}`, name });
  },
};

const eurowings = {
  airline: 'Eurowings',
  iataCode: 'EW',
  bookings: [],
};

const book = lufthansa.book;

// book(23, 'Akhila');
// ! Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'airline')
/* // ! IMP
Well, it's because this function here, the book function is now just a regular function call
and so as we learned in one of the previous sections,
in a regular function call, the this keyword points to undefined, at least in strict mode.
All right? So once more, this book function is no longer this method.
Okay?It's just not.
It is now this separate function here.
It's a copy of this one, but it's not a method anymore,
it's now a function. And so here it's a regular function call.
And so therefore, the this keyword inside of it will now point to undefined.
And that's why I kept telling you earlier
that the this keyword depends on how the function
is actually called.
Okay, so make sure to understand these dynamics here.
But now how do we actually fix this problem?
So in other words, how do we tell JavaScript that we want to create a booking
on the new Eurowings airline?
Or even how do we tell it that we want to book on Lufthansa here?
Well, basically, we need to tell JavaScript explicitly
what the this keyword here should be like.
So if we want to book a Lufthansa flight, the this keyword should point to Lufthansa
but if we want to book a Eurowings flight, then the this keyword should point to Eurowings.
So how do we do that? How do we tell JavaScript explicitly
or manually what this this keyword should look like?
Well, there are three function methods to do that
and they are call, apply and bind.
So when we first talked about the this keyword,
I think I mentioned these methods back then and so now we're gonna use them,
at least the call and apply methods.
*/
// ! CALL METHOD
book.call(eurowings, 23, 'Akhila');
console.log(eurowings);
/* 
And remember that a function is really just an object and objects have methods
and therefore, functions can have methods too and the call method is one of them.
And in the call method, the first argument is exactly
what we want the this keyword to point to. So let's say we want a Eurowings flight
and then as usual, the rest of the arguments.
*/

/*
So this time, we did actually not call the book function ourselves.
Instead, we called the call method and it's then this call method,
which will call the book function with the this keyword set to eurowings.
So whatever we pass has the first argument of the call method.
And so this allows us to manually and explicitly set the this keyword
of any function that we want to call.
Then all the arguments after the first one are simply the arguments of the original function.
*/

book.apply(swiss, flightData);
console.log(swiss);
// This apply method is not that used anymore in modern JavaScript because now,

book.call(swiss, ...flightData);
console.log(swiss);

// ! Bind Method
/*
And just like the call method, bind also allows us to manually set this keywords
for any function call.
Now, the difference is that bind does not immediately call the function.
Instead it returns a new function where this keyword is bound.
So it's set to whatever value we pass into bind.

/*
So, basically specifying parts of the argument beforehand,
is actually a common pattern called partial application.
So essentially, partial application means that a part of the arguments
of the original function are already applied, so which means, already set.
And so that's exactly what the bookEW23 function is.
*/

/*
But there are also other situations in which we can use the bind method
and where it is very useful.
And one example of that is when we use objects together
with event listeners.
*/
// ! With Event Listeners
lufthansa.planes = 300;
lufthansa.buyPlane = function () {
  console.log(this);
  this.planes++;
  console.log(this.planes);
};
// document.querySelector('.buy').addEventListener('click', lufthansa.buyPlane); // NaN
/*
And we get not a number here.So this.planes is now not a number.
And the reason for that is that this keyword is this button element, okay?
And do you know why that is? Well, in one of the theory lectures,
we learned that in an event handler function, that this keyword always points to the element
on which that handler is attached to.
So, this is the handler function, right?
And so it is attached to this element,so to this button.
And therefore, inside of the handler function or the event listener, it doesn't really matter.
But inside of this function, this keyword will point to the button element.
And so that's why this keyword here returns this button, okay?
So here you have yet another proof that this keyword really is set dynamically.
Because if we simply called a Lufthansa.buyPlane out here,then of course, this keyword would be Lufthansa,
so this object, right?
Because that's the object calling the function.
But in this case it is of course, this event listener function calling this function.
And so therefore, the button itself will then become this keyword, okay?

  const isPrivate = 23;
  var notPrivate = 46;
}
console.log(notPrivate); // 46
// console.log(isPrivate); // Uncaught ReferenceError: isPrivate is not defined
/*
So that's because this one here was declared with var, and therefore it does completely ignore
this block here essentially. And this is the reason why now in modern JavaScript,
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions are not that used anymore.
Because if all we want is to create a new scope for data privacy.
All we need to do, is to just create a block like this, right?
There's no need to creating a function to create a new scope.
Unless of course, we want to use var for our variables.
But we already know, we probably shouldn't do that. Right?
Now on the other hand, if what you really need,
is to execute a function just once, then the IIFE.
So the Immediately Invoked Function Expression pattern is still the way to go.

by the time it was created.
*/
/*
Any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context
in which the function was created.
Now, in the case of Booker, this function was created.
It was born in the execution context of secure booking,
which was popped off the stack previously, remember?
So, therefore the Booker function will get access to this variable environment,
which contains the passengerCount variable.
And this is how the function will be able to read and manipulate the passengerCount variable.
And so it's this connection that we call //! closure \\!.
*/
/*
So a function always has access to the variable environment
of the execution context in which it was created,
even after a that execution context is gone.
And this last part is really important.
The closure is then basically this variable environment
attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place
that the function was created.
*/

/*
let's see what happens now with execution of the Booker function.
So the function attempts to increase the passengerCount variable.
However, this variable is not in the current scope.
And so JavaScript will immediately look into the closure and see if it can find the variable there.
And it does this even before looking at the scope chain.
For example, if there was a global passengerCount variable set to 10, 
it would still first use the one in the closure.
So the closure basically has priority over the scope chain.
And so after running this function,
the passengerCount becomes one, This message is logged.
And then the execution context is popped off the stack.Then execution moves to the next line.
We get a new execution context and a closure is still there,
still attached to the function and the value is still one.
And so now this function executes, increasing the passengerCount to two
and logging a message again.

  was kind of born inside of g first
  and then it was essentially reborn again in h. And so first the closure contained the a variable
  of its first birthplace. And then as it was reborn to follow our analogy
  then it remembered this B variable off its birthplace.
